## Contribute Code

You are welcome to contribute code to the Ariba Extensibility Samples in order to fix bugs or to implement new samples.

There are three important things to know:

1.  You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and **agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin**. This is common practice in all major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using *[CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/)*. CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates with GitHub very well and enables a one-click-experience for accepting the DCO. See the respective section below for details.
2.  There are **several requirements regarding code style, quality, and product standards** which need to be met (we also have to follow them). The respective section below gives more details on the coding guidelines.
3.  **Not all proposed contributions can be accepted**. 


### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before they submit the first pull request to this project. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).  
This happens in an automated fashion during the submission process: the CLA assistant tool will add a comment to the pull request. Click it to check the DCO, then accept it on the following screen. CLA assistant will save this decision for upcoming contributions.

This DCO replaces the previously used CLA ("Contributor License Agreement") as well as the "Corporate Contributor License Agreement" with new terms which are well-known standards and hence easier to approve by legal departments. Contributors who had already accepted the CLA in the past may be asked once to accept the new DCO.
