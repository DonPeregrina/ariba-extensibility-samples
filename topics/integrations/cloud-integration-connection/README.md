# Step by step: How to configure SAP Cloud Integration to communicate with SAP Ariba by using the HTTP adapter

Here we cover how we can configure an integration flow in SAP Cloud Integration to communicate with the SAP Ariba Operational Reporting APIs.

We will build an integration flow in SAP Cloud Integration, process the request response using a Groovy script and store the request response in the data store.
